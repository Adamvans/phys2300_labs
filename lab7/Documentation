    Documentation for Programming Assignment M7: 
The N-Body simulation of the solar system
To start the program you can run: python Lab7.  
There is an optional argument of â€“file or -f.
if the argument is used then the next argument 
is the file path of the csv file that holds the 
data for the solar system. It will then inter 
all the data from the file and do the 8+1 body 
simulation.  It starts animating using the 
Euler-Cromer method and then animates using the 
Leapfrog method. The animation of the planets 
leave tails so make the planets easier to see.
 
    If there is no argument it will ask for 
the mass of the sun, and earth. And the 
position of the earth in x and y coordinates. 
And the velocity in x and y coordinates. It 
will then do the 2-body simulation. It starts 
animating using the Euler-Cromer method and then 
animates using the Leapfrog method.The animation 
of the planets leave tails so make the planets 
easier to see.
 
1. For fun, what happens to the Earth's orbit in 
the 2-body case when you increase the initial 
velocity to 35 km/s?
 
the orbit gets larger it is still a complete 
orbit but is no longer centered on the sun. 
it starts at the same location so this is the 
closest location to the son. The other parts of 
the orbit are all further.
 
2. What is the behavior of your code if you 
alter the time step? That is, what happens when 
the time step is longer than necessary? What 
happens if it is shorter than necessary?

If the steps are longer the animation is faster 
but at the cost of accuracy. The planets also 
appear to jump great distances. If the time step 
is shorter than the animation takes longer. The 
more steps the slower it is.
